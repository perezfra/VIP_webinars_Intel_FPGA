# VIP_webinars_Intel_FPGA
Video Processing Reference Designs for Intel FPGAs

##### Check the [latest updates](https://github.com/perezfra/VIP_webinars_Intel_FPGA/blob/main/Latest_updates.md) for new content added

This repository contains project files, lab manual guides and video tutorials to implement Video Processing Applications using Intel FPGAs.
We are running different sessions along Q4'2020 according to the following schedule:

### 1.  Building a video processing pipeline (Oct, 14th and 21st)
    - Getting video processed through the devkit, incremental flow
    - Detailed step flow on hardware implementation
    - Software application development using C++ API for a Nios II CPU    

### 2.  Strategies to debug a VIP pipeline (Nov, 4th)
    - Overview of system level considerations and key video concepts
    - Introduce the methods to build up and debug video systems
    - Use System Console to control VIP cores when you don't have CPU or software available yet
    - Overview of Avalon-ST Video protocol  

### 3.  Integrate a simple custom component (Nov, 19th)        
    - How to add your “secret sauce” to the application
    - Step flow on how to develop a custom component compliant with VIP

### 4.  Adding On Screen Display overlay (Dec, 16th)
    - Use a lightweight graphic library with Nios 
    - Add text and graphic content overlay on top of your live video

### You can register [here](https://webinar.intel.com/PSGVideoIPWebQ420-REG) to attend the live sessions

#### We will build the Video Processing Application pictured below. By following a detailed step guide, you will learn how to implement the hardware pipeline in the FPGA fabric and how to develop a control software application for an embedded Nios II processor.
